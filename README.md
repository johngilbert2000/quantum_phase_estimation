# Quantum Phase Estimation

This project implements Quantum Phase Estimation with an arbitrary number of qubits using `Qiskit==0.18.0`.

This is a final project for a Quantum Algorithms course at NTU, offered by Professor Wen-Chin Chen (陳文進). References for the project include notes by Professor Chen as well as qiskit.org.
